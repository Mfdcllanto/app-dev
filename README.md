This series has been there for me since my childhood and my cousins and I used to watch it together. When I was a kid, I wasn't aware about what is happening in the show and I only care about the funny scenes but as soon as I get older, I slowly understand the struggles of the characters and I can relate myself to the characters.

# Kimi ni Todoke

This anime series is also one of my favorite and I've been watching them a lot of times whenever I want to. This is about a girl who was misunderstood by many people and associated her with the iconic horror character "Sadako". She was trying to break the ice between her classmate but they really are scared with her presence. With the help of a friend, Kazehaya, she was able to be more open with other people and met good friends along her highschool journey. As a high school student back then, this was my show because it talks about love and friendship.
